Xiaoyu Wang

1. Is your solution fully working or not? 
- Yes, my solution is fully working.

2. Do you believe your unit tests to be complete to test the module's contract?  If not, why not?
- Yes.

3. What extra credit problem(s) did you work on (#1, 2, both)? Briefly describe how do you demonstrate the functionality?
- I didn't work on Extra Credit problems. I felt like I didn't get enough time to deal with them.

How much time did you spend on the assignment?
- 12 hours. I spent the first 4-5 hours to read the instructions and make the designed structure  clear enough. 

4. Any feedback on the assignment?
- I started with the easier parts, like the encryptor class, then PasswordVault class, finally I implemented it in the Driver. I also tried different solutions to validate names and passwords. Overall I think this assignment is very good for me to understand what I learned from the lecture. What's difficult to me is the instructions on the Menu implementation is not enough.
