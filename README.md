# 5011-Object-Oriented-Concept HW1 Greeter Module

1. Is your solution fully working or not? How does your driver program demonstrate this?
- Yes, the solution is fully working. I created a ZippyQuote class to handle the zippy file and read random quotes from the file.
The driver program firstly loads Zippy quotes from the yow.lines file using the ZippyQuote class I created.
And then uses the Greeter and Template classes to generate a greeting that includes:
1) The $daypart, $name, and $color variables.
2) A newline before the Zippy quote ($newline).
3) A random Zippy quote inserted at the end of the greeting ($zippy).

2. What extra credit problem(s) did you work on (#1, 2, 3, all)? Briefly describe how do you demonstrate the functionality?

3. How much time did you spend on the assignment?
- 12 hours, approximately.

4. Any feedback on the assignment?

This is a fake answer.
